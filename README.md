# shittrumpsays

This program uses a dataset of Trump tweets and Markov Chains to generate shit trump (could) say.

Some short info about Markov Models from jdermody:

Markov Models can be used to create n-gram based language models - 
that is they can be used to calculate the probability of subsequent tokens after each n-gram.
Generated text from n-gram based language models, although not always syntactically correct, 
does roughly approximate the training corpus. Some of the generated text is in fact quite interesting!
